# Math Operations
Let's take a look at some commonly used math operations

## Addition
Adds numbers.
* 4 + 3 = 7
* 8 + 3 = 11

## Subtraction
Subtracts numbers.
* 8 - 3 = 5
* 7 - 5 = 2

## Multiplication
Multiplies numbers.
* 2 * 3 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
* 3 * 4 = 12

## Division
Divides numbers.
* 12 / 4 = 3
* 3 / 2 = 1.5

## Integer Division
Divides numbers and rounds down to the nearest integer.
* 12 // 4 = 3
* 3 // 2 = 1

## Exponent
Raises a base number to the power of an exponent.
* 2 ** 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
* 3 ** 3 = 27

## Modulus
The remainder operator.
* 3 % 2 = 1 (2 goes into 3 one time with a remainder of 1)
* 2 % 2 = 0
